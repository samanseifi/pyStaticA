pyStaticA is a simple software for analysing froce-displacement type data from performance testing of mechanical constructs or
materials testings such as tensile, bending, torsion etc where the charachterstic curve has a linear portion followed by a
non-linear portion with a yield point defined as the offset of the linear part.
