pyStaticA is a simple engineering code for analysing froce-displacement type data from performance testing of mechanical constructs or materials testings such as tensile, bending, torsion etc where the charachterstic curve has a linear portion followed by a
non-linear portion with a yield point defined as the limit of linear portion.

The method for finidng the yield is the offset method with the amount is given as an input by the user.

The software takes an input file contatins line of information linking xy-data in `csv` to the given offset points.
